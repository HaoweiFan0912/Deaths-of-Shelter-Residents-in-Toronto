Plz tell me how to use Styler in Code, to format my code

ChatGPT-4o
To use the **`styler`** package in R for code formatting, follow these steps:
### 1. Install the `styler` package:
If you haven't already installed `styler`, you can do so with the following command:
```r
install.packages("styler")
```
### 2. Load the `styler` package:
Load the package in your R environment:
```r
library(styler)
```
### 3. Format your code:
You can format your code in different ways using functions from `styler`. Here are some of the common functions:
#### a) **Format a single R script file:**
```r
style_file("your_script.R")
```
This will format the code inside the specified file.
#### b) **Format multiple files in a directory:**
If you want to format all `.R` files in a specific directory, you can use:
```r
style_dir("your_directory_path")
```
This will format all R files in the given directory.
#### c) **Format code directly in R:**
You can also format a block of code directly in the R console. For example:
```r
style_text("x <-function( y ){y +1 }")
```
The above code will return the formatted version of your input:
```r
x <- function(y) {
  y + 1
}
```
#### d) **Addins for RStudio (if using RStudio):**
If you're using RStudio, `styler` also provides an RStudio addin for interactive use. To access this:
1. Highlight the code you want to format in the editor.
2. Go to the **Addins** menu in RStudio and select **Style active file** or **Style selection**.
This will format the selected code or the entire file.
